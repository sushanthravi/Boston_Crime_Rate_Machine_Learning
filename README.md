# Boston_Crime_Rate_Machine_Learning
In this project, I analyzed the Boston and Austin Housing Datasets to predict crime rates. I applied linear and polynomial regression, ridge and lasso regression to prevent overfitting, and regression trees for interpretability. I used cross-validation and RMSE to evaluate model performance and select the best models.

# Project: Predicting Crime Rates and House Prices

In this project, I worked with the **Boston Housing Dataset** and **Austin Housing Dataset** to predict key outcomes like crime rates and house prices. I began by performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify relationships between variables such as population characteristics and housing prices, using visualizations to uncover patterns. I built various machine learning models, including **linear regression** and **polynomial regression**, to predict these outcomes. To improve performance and reduce overfitting, I applied **ridge** and **lasso regression**, which helped in selecting the most relevant features by penalizing less important ones.

For the **Austin Housing Dataset**, I used **regression trees** to predict house prices, providing an interpretable model that highlighted key predictors. I evaluated all models using **cross-validation** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to ensure robust model selection. Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in various machine learning techniques, including **regression methods**, **shrinkage techniques**, **tree-based models**, and **model evaluation**, allowing me to optimize predictions and understand the underlying patterns in the data.
