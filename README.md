# Boston_Crime_Rate_Machine_Learning
In this project, I analyzed the Boston and Austin Housing Datasets to predict crime rates. I applied linear and polynomial regression, ridge and lasso regression to prevent overfitting, and regression trees for interpretability. I used cross-validation and RMSE to evaluate model performance and select the best models.
